This application allows you to sort arrays using QuickSort, MergeSort, or HeapSort.
You can also generate random arrays and view sorting metrics.
1. To generate an array randomly, input its size and the minimum and maximum possible values.
Size = [1, 100000]; Min = [-1000000, 1000000]; Max = [-1000000, 1000000].
2. You can also manually input an array. Format: integers separated by commas.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm: QuickSort, MergeSort, or HeapSort.
4. After pressing one of the sorting buttons, you will see the sorted array and sorting metrics.
5. Once the array is sorted, you can download the metrics in CSV format. To do this, you need to input a file path.
